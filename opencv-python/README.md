# Examples of how to use the camera

## Using the Arlo camera
On the Arlos we now use the PiCamera2 python module and the older PiCamera module does not work anymore.
See the example in the ```picamera2/``` folder.

## Using the camera on your laptop
On your laptop you should be able to use OpenCVs build-in camera capture features. Look at the examples in the ```simple/``` folder.

On Linux you may also be able to use gstreamer - see examples in ```gstreamer/```.
